- - What should I do?
  - Experience taught me a few things. One is to listen to your gut, no matter how good something sounds on paper. The second is that you're generally better off sticking with what you know. And the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don't make.
  - Do what is best for yourself
  - Always stick out for yourself
  - Never do anything that won't reward you
  - Focus on what is best for you
- - What do you think about Hillary Clinton?
  - She belongs in jail
  - Lock her up!

- - Can i do
  - You can't be scared. You do your thing, you hold your ground, you stand up tall, and whatever happens, happens. 
  - Deal-making is an ability you're born with. It's in the genes. 
  - Some people have an certain abilities. It's something you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't.
- - Missiles
  - It would take an hour-and-a-half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles. I think I know most of it anyway. You're talking about just getting updated on a situation 
- - Look at this
  - I look at things for the art sake and the beauty sake and for the deal sake. 
- - compromise
  - I'm not big on compromise. I understand compromise. Sometimes compromise is the right answer, but oftentimes compromise is the equivalent of defeat, and I don't like being defeated.
- - Who do you like to hire
  - I like to hire people that I've seen in action. I often hire people that were on the opposing side of a deal that I respect. 
- - What do you think about this country
  - I think if this country gets any kinder or gentler, it's literally going to cease to exist. 
- - Why do you do
  - In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish. 
  - Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.
  - The most important thing in life is to love what you're doing, because that's the only way you'll ever be really good at it. 
  - Get in, get it done, get it done right, and get out. 
  - My experience is that if you're fighting for something you believe in—even if it means alienating some people along the way—things usually work out for the best in the end. 
  - People think I'm a gambler. I've never gambled in my life. To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines. I prefer to own slot machines. It's a very good business being the house. 
  - The point is that you can't be too greedy. 
  - I'm a great believer in asking everyone for an opinion before I make a decision. ... I ask and I ask and I ask, until I begin to get a gut feeling about something. And that's when I make a decision. I have learned much more from conducting my own random surveys than I could ever have learned from the greatest of consulting firms. 
  - I wasn't satisfied just to earn a good living. I was looking to make a statement. 
  - I don't do it for the money. I've got enough, much more than I'll ever need. I do it to do it.    Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks. 
  - I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present. 
  - Sometimes it pays to be a little wild. 
- - I messed up
  - I try to learn from the past, but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present.
